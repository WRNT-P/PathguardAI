"""Ranked caregivers (A4) and "I'll go and get them" (A5), 2026-08-28.

The report's line is "alert every caregiver, ranked by distance, tap to claim".
The fan-out shipped with the schema; these are the other two thirds.

The design decision most of this file exists to hold down: **a caregiver whose
position is stale, or missing entirely, is demoted — never removed.** Filtering
by freshness is the obvious implementation and it fails in the worst possible
place. The app side has not yet said how often it reports a position, so any
cut-off is a guess, and a guess that is tighter than reality turns this endpoint
into "nobody is available" at the moment a patient is missing. A list in the
wrong order is something a human standing there can still read.

The claim's rule is the opposite one, and equally deliberate: exactly one person
can hold an alert, and a second caregiver is told *who* holds it. Two people
driving to the same place while a third assumes it is handled is the accident
this feature exists to prevent.
